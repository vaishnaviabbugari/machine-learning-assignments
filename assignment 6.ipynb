    "Ans: The No Free Lunch Theorem, often abbreviated as NFL or NFLT, is a theoretical finding that suggests all optimization algorithms perform equally well when their performance is averaged over all possible objective functions. In computational complexity and optimization the no free lunch theorem is a result that states that for certain types of mathematical problems, the computational cost of finding a solution, averaged over all problems in the class, is the same for any solution method.\n",

    "Ans: In K-fold cross validation, data D is subset into k subsets randomly. Let us assume S1...Sk are the subsets where Sk is the kth randomly split subset of data D. In the first iteration, D-S1 is used for training and S1 for testing the model. When the model has been trained and tested, evaluation can be done, score is noted elsewhere and the trained model is discarded.\n",

    "Importantly, samples are constructed by drawing observations from a large data sample one at a time and returning them to the data sample after they have been chosen. This allows a given observation to be included in a given small sample more than once. This approach to sampling is called sampling with replacement.\n"

    "Ans: Kappa value or Cohen's Kappa coefficient is an evaluation metric for classification models. Its significance as an evaluation metric is that it can be used to evaluate multi class classification models and also works on models trained on imbalanced datasets(scores like accuracy scores fail for imbalanced datasets).\n",

Cohen's kappa is always less than or equal to 1. Values of 0 or less, indicate that the classifier is useless Cohen suggested the Kappa result be interpreted as follows: values ≤ 0 as indicating no agreement and 0.01–0.20 as none to slight, 0.21–0.40 as fair, 0.41– 0.60 as moderate, 0.61–0.80 as substantial, and 0.81–1.00 as almost perfect agreement.\n"

    "Ans: A descriptive model is used for tasks that would benefit from the insight gained from summarizing data in new and interesting ways. As opposed to predictive models that predict a target of interest, in a descriptive model, no single feature is more important than any other. In fact, because there is no target to learn, the process of training a descriptive model is called unsupervised learning.\n"

R square measures how much of the change in target variable can be explained by the linear regressor. Its value ranges from 0 to 1 where 0 means poor performance and 1 means good.
