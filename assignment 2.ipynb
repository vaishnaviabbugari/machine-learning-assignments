    "Ans: A Reinforcement Learning Algorithm, which may also be referred to as an agent, learns by interacting with its environment. The agent receives rewards by performing correctly and penalties for performing incorrectly. The agent learns without intervention from a human by maximizing its reward and minimizing its penalty.\n"
